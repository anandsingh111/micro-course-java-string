Indexing starts with zero, which is why the program above will print 6, not 7. Therefore, if you had a `String` "Java":<br>

 Index: 0 1 2 3<br>

 String: J a v a

Another way to use the `indexOf()` method is by putting an valid index after the target `String`. This tells the method where you want to start searching for the target `String`. As we see in the example above, the index of "World" is 6, meaning if we start searching from index 7, we will not find the `String` "World", thus returning -1.
