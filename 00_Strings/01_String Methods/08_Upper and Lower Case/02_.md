These two methods may be useful when you want to change the `String` so that it will print in a particular way. On the other hand, you can use the method for personal preference or when you want to compare two strings while ignoring the differences in uppercase or lowercase. (Although `compareToIgnoreCase()` and `equalsIgnoreCase()` does exist)
