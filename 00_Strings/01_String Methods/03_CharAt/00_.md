Now that we have explored the concept of index in Java, let's see the index related functions that exist in the `String` class. The `charAt` method returns a single character from a specified index. The syntax is as follows, `stringname.charAt(any integer)` and the return value is a single character `char`, not a `String`. In a case where the index is negative or greater than `stringname.length()-1`, you will receive a runtime error. Let's see a few examples of the `charAt` method.
