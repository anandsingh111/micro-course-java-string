The index for the first character of a `String` has an index of zero, meaning 'H' is printed when the statement `exampleVariableOne.charAt(0);` is called. If you point at an index where there is a space, the `charAt()` method will return a character containing ' '. This method, along with `indexOf()` method are extremely useful when working with strings.
