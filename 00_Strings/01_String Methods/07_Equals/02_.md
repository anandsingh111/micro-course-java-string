When using the "==" operator to compare the strings, we receive a result of "false" because the strings reference two different objects that are held in different memory spaces. However, if a statement like `String varTwo = varOne;` is called after `String varOne = "Java";`, the reference for the variable `varTwo` is the same as the reference of `varOne`, meaning that the "==" operator has a result of "true". This only works if the first `String` is directly assigned to the value of the second `String`.
