One of the most useful methods when working with `String` is the `equals()` method. Every `String` is an object, which means the "==" operator checks whether or not the reference (not value) for the `String` objects are the same. Because of this distinction, we need the equals method to check whether or not they hold the same `String` value (basically the text). The syntax for the equals method is `stringname.equals(stringname)`. Take a look at the difference between the equals method and the "==" operator when working with strings below.
