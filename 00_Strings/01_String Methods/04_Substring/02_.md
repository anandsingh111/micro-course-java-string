The first method, `substring(int startIndex)` returns a new `String` containing the characters between "startIndex" and the final index of the called `String`, so the statement `exampleVariableOne.substring(6)` returns the entire string "World!". If the "startIndex" is equal to the total length of the string, an empty string is created.

The second method, `substring(int startIndex, int endIndex)` returns a new `String` made up of the characters beginning at the "startIndex" and ending at the "endIndex - 1". This method includes the first character and excludes the last character of the parameters entered. As long as both inputs are valid indexes of the `String` you won't throw a runtime error.

As discussed before, strings are immutable, so a new `String` is created every time you call either of the `substring()` methods.
