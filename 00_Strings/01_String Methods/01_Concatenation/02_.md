Keep in mind the concept of immutability when it comes to strings. The first two strings, `exampleVariableOne` and `exampleVariableTwo`, are not altered by the action of `concat()`. A brand new `String` is created that is made up of the characters "Hello World!".

Do you remember the '+' operator? It may also be used instead of the `concat()` method, as you see above. Both the operator and the method do the exact same thing, so you as the programmer may choose whichever one you are more comfortable with and fits your coding style.

This is your friendly reminder that if the first operand in front of the '+' operator is a `String` and the ones that come after are not, everything that comes after the `String` will be changed to be a `String`, and the '+' operator will behave as concatenation, not addition.
