The `compareTo()` method returns 0 if the two strings are equal, a number less than 0 if the first `String` is larger, and a number greater than 0 if the second `String` is larger. Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters when the method compares strings. As you work through learning this method's function, test our example program and use the ascii table to see how far apart the characters are from each other.
