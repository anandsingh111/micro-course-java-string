The original text has extra spaces before and after, making it inefficient and odd-looking when printed. This method creates a new `String` without added spaces at the beginning or the end while leaving the space in between.

The trim method is extremely useful when the programmer deals with user input data within the application. Extraneous spaces on either end of user input is a common problem, and those issues are easily solved using the trim method.
