Did you run the program? Did you see how an empty `String` has a length of zero? Take note of the fact that the length method takes no parameters but the parenthesis are part of the necessary syntax to call the method, along with the dot which tells the program that you want to use the length method that exists in the `String` class.

Please keep in mind for future sections, that the length of the `String` has nothing to do with the index. You can just count up the number of characters inside the `String` to determine the accurate length.
