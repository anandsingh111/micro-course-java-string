There are two distinct ways to create a `String`: use double-quotation marks or create a new object. Either put text on the same line in double quotation marks as if it was primitive datatype: `String stringName = "hi";` or initialize them like this: `String stringName = new String("hi");`. Take a look below for examples on how we can initialize a `String`.
