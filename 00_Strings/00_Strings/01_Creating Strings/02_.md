To create a new object, we use the Java reserved word `new` because `String` is a class within the `java.lang` package. However, Java has made the process of importing easier for programmers. As you see above, you can initialize the `String` without having to type out `new`. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which method of creating a `String` works best for you.

Remember, it is possible to create an empty `String` by either leaving the parenthesis blank or omitting characters on the inside of the double-quotation marks.
