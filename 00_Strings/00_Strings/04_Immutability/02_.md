We can assign `exampleVariableOne` to a new `String` object ("Java") before it is printed. However, the old `String` object ("HelloWorld") still exists because it cannot be changed. The reassignment of a variable does not replace the old string with the new one as it only replaces the reference. This means that both strings still exist but only one of them is being used.

Take a look at this line of code: `String varOne = "Hi";` Let's revisit the concept. The reference variable `varOne` does not contain the object, but only a reference to the object. What this reference is and what object it points to can change at anytime in the program. But the `String` object "Hi" remains unaltered because it is immutable.

On a side-note, constantly creating "Strings" could lead to overflowing the memory when running the code.
