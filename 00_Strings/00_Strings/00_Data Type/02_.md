In Java, `String` is a line of text that strings together letters or numbers and stores them as a sequence of characters. The string "Hi!" is made up of the characters 'H', 'i', and '!'.

Let's take a look at how the Java operator '+' works with strings and other data types like integers. If a `String` is before the '+' operator and followed by a non-string value, the '+' operator converts the non-string value into a string and chains them together. For example `System.out.println("Hi" + 1 + 2);` will not print "Hi3". Instead, it will print "Hi12" as the '+' sign changes the '1' and '2' to strings before chaining the strings together. The '1' and '2' are no longer integers and do not qualify for addition. It is best to avoid arithmetic calculation if a `String` exists before the addition.
