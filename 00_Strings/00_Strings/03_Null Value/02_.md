In Java, variables created from the `String` class are like containers, they hold a reference to an object. Therefore, creating 10 strings will create 10 objects and 10 different variables that refer to the different objects. If variables that hold objects exist, we need a way to describe those variables that are not holding or referencing anything - this is where the null value comes in. It tells us that nothing is being held or referenced by the `String`.
