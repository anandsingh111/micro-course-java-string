1. `\\` <br>

 Permits a '\' to be included in the `String`. One '\' is used to escape the string, and the second '\' is added into the string.

2. `\"` <br>

 Using one \" on each side of characters and enclose them in quotations when printing. Since the double-quotations are used to denote a `String` in the source code, we need to use something else, the backslashes, to tell the program to print "" in the output.
 
3. `\n` <br>

 Makes a new line, so anything in the `String` after the "\n" prints on a new line. In the example above, "Java" is printed on a new line because there is an "\n" directly before it in the code.

Keep these useful tools in mind when working with strings.
