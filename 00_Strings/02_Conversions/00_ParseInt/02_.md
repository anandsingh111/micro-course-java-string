The `parseInt()` method returns an `int`, not an object from the `Integer` class. This method only works if the `String` consists solely of numbers and no characters. If that is not the case, an error will be thrown and an integer will not be created.

The `parseInt()` function is extremely useful when dealing with user input or calculating numbers from text files. With this method, Java is saving the programmer time from creating long methods to convert strings into integers, by having an included `parseInt()` method.
