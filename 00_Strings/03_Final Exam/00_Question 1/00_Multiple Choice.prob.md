>>Consider the following code segment:
<pre><code>String varOne = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(varOne.toUpperCase());
</code></pre>
<p>What is printed as a result of executing this code segment?</p><<

(x) HELLO WORLD! {{Correct because all the letters are converted to upper case.}}
( ) hello world! {{Incorrect because all the letters are converted to lower case.}}
( ) HellO WorlD! {{Incorrect because only some of letters are converted to upper case.}}
( ) HELLO WORLD {{Incorrect because it is missing the exclamation mark at the end.}}
( ) An error will be thrown. {{Incorrect because the statements above will compile successfully without any errors.}}

||The <code>to.UpperCase()</code> method and writing the whole <code>String</code> in "caps lock" produce the same result. ||
